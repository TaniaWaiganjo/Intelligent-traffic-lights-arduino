90% of traffic light controlled roundabouts and junctions in Nairobi are traditional despite the fact technology to capture real-time data on traffic exists . 
This causes long wait times at traffic lights and ineffective traffic management.
Simple sensors such as pressure sensors, infrared sensors, PIR sensors and motion sensors can be used to determine queue lengths of each lane approaching the roundabout. 
An algorithm optimizing green time depending on the amount of traffic on each lane can be used to generate a lookup table storing amount of time to allocate each road. 
This project seeks to demonstrate that using Arduino micro-controller and various components.
